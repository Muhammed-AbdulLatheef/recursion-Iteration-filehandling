Question 2: Pointers and Functions 
Write a C program to model currency exchange transaction at a bank. The program should implement the function curr_change described below according to its specifications. 

In the main function, create a data structure to store the exchange rates between the local currency and a set of international currencies (for both buying and selling); you should include at least three international currencies. The currencies should be modelled using C-strings.

For simplicity, assume that the maximum exchangeable amount is fixed (based on the local currency). Exchanges can only occur between the local currency and one international currency, either as sell or buy operation. 

In the main function, prompt the user to input the amount of money, its currency, and the target currency. Your program should validate user’s input before being processed. For valid inputs, the program should then display the exchange rate, the converted amount, any leftover amount, and the bank’s cap on the transaction amount.

The function curr_change is defined as follows: 
void curr_change (float amCur1, float amMax, float excRate, float *amCur2,float *leftOver) 
Where the parameters: 
• amCur1: specifies the amount in currency1 provided by a customer. 
• amMax: specifies the maximum amount in local currency which can be exchanged at the bank. 
• excRate: specifies the exchange rate from currency 1 to currency 2. 
• amCur2: specifies the amount the customer gets in Currency2. 
• leftOver: specifies the non-converted amount in currency 1 returned to the customer if amMax gets exceeded. 
The parameters amCur2 and leftOver must be used as pointers in the function.


A text file named students.txt contains student records, each consisting of a name (string) and a
 mark (integer), the file is attached. 
However, the file may contain corrupted or incomplete records, for example, missing names, missing 
marks, or non-printable characters in the name field. 
Write a C program to: 
a) Read all records from the text file
 b) Validate each record as follows:
 • The name field must be non-empty and consist of printable, non-numeric characters1.
 • The mark field must be an integer. For simplicity, we assume that if the mark field is
 numerical, its value is integer.
 c) If a record is invalid (corrupted), skip it by moving the file pointer to the next line
 d) Display:
 • Each valid record as it is read.
 • The total number of valid and corrupted records.
 • The average mark of valid records (if any).
 e) Handle possible file I/O errors (e.g., file not found).
 What to submit 
• C code concisely commented along with evidence of testing.
 • Explain, with reference to the relevant code statements, how you handled corrupted data in the file.
